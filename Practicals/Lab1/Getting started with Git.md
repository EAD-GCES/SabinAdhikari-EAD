# **Getting started with Git**

## **SETUP**

### Configuring user information used across all local repositories

`git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”`
> set a name that is identifiable for credit when reviewing version history

`git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”`
> set an email address that will be associated with each history maker

&nbsp;

## **SETUP & INIT**

### Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories

`git init`
> initialize an existing directory as a Git repository

`git clone [url]`
> retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL

&nbsp;

## **STAGE & SNAPSHOT**

### Working with snapshots and Git staging area

`git status`
> show modified files in the working directory, staged for your next commit

`git add [file]`
> add a file as it looks now to your next commit(stage)

`git reset [file]`
> unstage a file while retaining the changes in the working directory

`git diff`
> diff of what is changed but not staged

`git diff --staged`
> diff of what is staged but not yet committed

`git commit -m "[descriptive message]`
> commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

&nbsp;

## **BRANCH & MERGE**

### Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

`git branch`
> list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch

`git branch [branch-name]`
> create a new branch at the current commit

`git branch -d [branch-name]`
> delete the specified branch

`git checkout`
> switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory

`git checkout -b [branch-name]`
> create a new branch at the current commit and check it out into your working directory

`git merge [branch]`
> merge the specified branch's history into the current one

`git log`
> show all commits in the current branch's history

&nbsp;

## **INSPECT & COMPARE**

### Examining logs, diffs, and object information

`git log`
> show the commit history for the current active branch

`git log branchB..branchA`
> show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB

`git log --follow [file]`
> show the commits that changed file, even across renames

`git diff branchB...branchA`
> show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB

`git show [SHA]`
> show any object in Git in human-readable format

&nbsp;

## **TRACKING PATH CHANGES**

### Versioning file removes and path changes

`git rm [file]`
> delete the file from the project and stage the removal for commit

`git mv [existing-path] [new-path]`
> change an existing file path and stage the move

`git log --stat -M`
> show all commit logs with the indication of any paths that moved

&nbsp;

## **IGNORING PATTERNS**

### Preventing unintentional staging or committing of files

`logs/`

`*.notes`

`pattern*/`

> Save a file with desired patterns as .gitignore with either direct string matches or wildcard globs.

`git config --global core.excludesfile [file]`
> system-wide ignore pattern for all local repositories

&nbsp;

## **SHARE & UPDATE / SYNCHRONIZE CHANGES**

### Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos. Synchronize local repository with the remote repository

`git remote add [alias] [url]`
> add a git URL as an alias

`git fetch [alias]`
> fetch down all the branches from that Git remote

`git merge [alias]/[branch]`
> merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date

`git push [alias] [branch]`
> Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch

`git pull`
> fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch

&nbsp;

## **REWRITE HISTORY**

### Rewriting branches, updating commits, and clearing history

`git rebase [branch]`
> apply any commits of a current branch ahead of the specified one

`git reset [commit]`
> undo all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally

`git reset --hard [commit]`
> clear staging area, rewrite working tree from the specified commit

&nbsp;

## **TEMPORARY COMMITS**

### Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches

`git stash`
> Save modified and staged changes

`git stash list`
> list stack-order of stashed file changes

`git stash pop`
> write working from the top of stash stack

`git stash drop`
> discard the changes from th top of stash stack

&nbsp;

## **GLOSSARY**

- **git**: an open source, distributed version-control system

- **GitHub**: a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories

- **commit**: a Git object, a snapshot of your entire repository compressed into an SHA

- **branch**: a lightweight movable pointer to a commit

- **clone**: a local version of a repository, including all commits and branches

- **remote**: a common repository on GitHub that all team members use to exchange their changes

- **fork**: a copy of a repository on GitHub owned by a different user

- **pull request**: a place to compare and discuss the differences introduced on a branch with reviews, comments, integrated tests, and more

- **HEAD**: representing your current working directory, the HEAD pointer can be moved to different branches, tags, or commits when using git switch
